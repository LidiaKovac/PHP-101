# PHP 101 🧑‍🔬

Hi! My name is Lidia 👋

If you have just stumpled upon this repo while going through my GitHub, welcome! 

I am a MERN Stack developer, recently graduated from Strive School. This means I have knowledge of MongoDB (and Postgres), Express.js, React.js and Node.js. 

I am now trying to expand my tech stack by learning something new, PHP! 
This is mainly a white board for me to understand the very basics of the language. Since I already use a frontend library (React), I will not use this to create pages, but rather for my backend projects. 💻

Do you have feedback? Do not hesitate! Coding is all about always learning something new!
